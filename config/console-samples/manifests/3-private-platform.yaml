  description: >
    The default PloigosPlatform deployment assumes that your OpenShift Router
    is equipped with a certificate signed by a well-known certificate authority.
    If your certificates are signed using a private CA instead, you can provide the
    name of a ConfigMap which holds your trusted CA Bundle. The ConfigMap should
    have a single key named ca-bundle.crt. This key has a collection of CA certificates
    as its value. If the provided ConfigMap exists, it will be used as-is.
    Otherwise, it will be generated using a label of config.openshift.io/inject-trusted-cabundle=true
    and populated with the Cluster Network Operator.
